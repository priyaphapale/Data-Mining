The objective here is to build a college acceptance rate predictor suggesting the chance of admit a student has depending on the past academics and research. While many factors are still taken into consideration the academics - GPA, GRE/SAT scores and research work stand the most prominent ones in the judging criteria. Machine learning techniques have evolved so far in these years to help us study the behaviour of data thus enabling us to take knowledge driven decisions. There are thousands of ML techniques and I have used decision tree for the predictive model analysis.

Decision Trees is a powerful machine learning technique capable of both classification and prediction. It is a hierarchical model of supervised learning comprising of internal decision nodes and terminal leaves. I have used Decision tree - CART algorithm for prediction of the target variable.

Linear Regression is the most commonly used machine learning technique for prediction analysis. I have also used the above feature set to predict the admittance rate for student using Linear regression.I have also calculated the coefficients of the Linear Regression model, the higher the value of the co-efficient the more weightage the predictor variable has.
